<h1 id="How-to-Contribute"><a href="#How-to-Contribute" class="headerlink" title="How to Contribute"></a>How to Contribute</h1><p>CoreOS projects are <a href="LICENSE">Apache 2.0 licensed</a> and accept contributions via<br>GitHub pull requests.  This document outlines some of the conventions on<br>development workflow, commit message formatting, contact points and other<br>resources to make it easier to get your contribution accepted.</p>
<h1 id="Certificate-of-Origin"><a href="#Certificate-of-Origin" class="headerlink" title="Certificate of Origin"></a>Certificate of Origin</h1><p>By contributing to this project you agree to the Developer Certificate of<br>Origin (DCO).

<h1 id="Email-and-Chat"><a href="#Email-and-Chat" class="headerlink" title="Email and Chat"></a>Email and Chat</h1><p>The project currently uses the general CoreOS email list and IRC channel:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email: <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/coreos-dev">coreos-dev</a></li>
<li>IRC: #<a href="irc://irc.freenode.org:6667/#coreos">coreos</a> IRC channel on freenode.org</li>
</ul>
<p>Please avoid emailing maintainers found in the MAINTAINERS file directly. They<br>are very busy and read the mailing lists.</p>
<h2 id="Getting-Started"><a href="#Getting-Started" class="headerlink" title="Getting Started"></a>Getting Started</h2><ul>
<li>Fork the repository on GitHub</li>
<li>Read the <a href="README.md">README</a> for build and test instructions</li>
<li>Play with the project, submit bugs, submit patches!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Contribution-Flow"><a href="#Contribution-Flow" class="headerlink" title="Contribution Flow"></a>Contribution Flow</h2><p>This is a rough outline of what a contributor’s workflow looks like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work (usually master).</li>
<li>Make commits of logical units.</li>
<li>Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format (see below).</li>
<li>Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.</li>
<li>Make sure the tests pass, and add any new tests as appropriate.</li>
<li>Submit a pull request to the original repository.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for your contributions!</p>
<h3 id="Coding-Style"><a href="#Coding-Style" class="headerlink" title="Coding Style"></a>Coding Style</h3><p>CoreOS projects written in Go follow a set of style guidelines that we’ve documented<br><a href="https://github.com/coreos/docs/tree/master/golang">here</a>. Please follow them when<br>working on your contributions.</p>
<h3 id="Format-of-the-Commit-Message"><a href="#Format-of-the-Commit-Message" class="headerlink" title="Format of the Commit Message"></a>Format of the Commit Message</h3><p>We follow a rough convention for commit messages that is designed to answer two<br>questions: what changed and why. The subject line should feature the what and<br>the body of the commit should describe the why.</p>
<pre><code>scripts: add the test-cluster command

this uses tmux to setup a test cluster that you can easily kill and
start for debugging.

Fixes #38</code></pre>
<p>The format can be described more formally as follows:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;subsystem&gt;: &lt;what changed&gt;
&lt;BLANK LINE&gt;
&lt;why this change was made&gt;
&lt;BLANK LINE&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The first line is the subject and should be no longer than 70 characters, the<br>second line is always blank, and other lines should be wrapped at 80 characters.<br>This allows the message to be easier to read on GitHub as well as in various<br>git tools.</p>
