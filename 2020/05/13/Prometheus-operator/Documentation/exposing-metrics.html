<h1 id="Exposing-Metrics"><a href="#Exposing-Metrics" class="headerlink" title="Exposing Metrics"></a>Exposing Metrics</h1><p>There are a number of <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/#directly-instrumented-software">applications</a> that are natively instrumented with Prometheus metrics. Those applications simply expose the metrics through an HTTP server.</p>
<p>The Prometheus developers and the community are maintaining <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/clientlibs/#client-libraries">client libraries</a> for various languages. If you want to monitor your own applications and instrument them natively, chances are there is already a client library for your language.</p>
<p>Not all software is natively instrumented with Prometheus metrics, but still record metrics in some other form. For these kinds of applications there are so called <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/#third-party-exporters">exporters</a>.</p>
<p>Exporters can generally be divided into two categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Instance exporters: These expose metrics about a single instance of an application. For example the HTTP requests that a single HTTP server has exporters served. These exporters are deployed as a <a href="http://blog.kubernetes.io/2015/06/the-distributed-system-toolkit-patterns.html">side-car</a> container in the same pod as the actual instance of the respective application.  A real life example is the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/dns/blob/master/docs/sidecar/README.md"><code>dnsmasq</code> metrics sidecar</a>, which converts the proprietary metrics format communicated over the DNS protocol by <code>dnsmasq</code> to the Prometheus exposition format and exposes it on an HTTP server.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cluster-state exporters: These expose metrics about an entire system. For example these could be the number of 3D objects in a game, or metrics about a Kubernetes deployment. These exporters are typically deployed as a normal Kubernetes deployment, but can vary depending on the nature of the particular exporter. A real life example of this is the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics"><code>kube-state-metrics</code></a> exporter, which exposes metrics about the cluster state of a Kubernetes cluster.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly in some cases it is not a viable option to expose metrics via an HTTP server. For example a <code>CronJob</code> may only run for a few seconds - not long enough for Prometheus to be able to scrape the HTTP endpoint. The Pushgateway was developed to be able to collect metrics for that kind of a scenario. If possible it is highly recommended not to use the Pushgateway. Read more about when to use the Pushgateway and alternative strategies here: <a href="https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/pushing/#should-i-be-using-the-pushgateway">https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/pushing/#should-i-be-using-the-pushgateway</a>.</p>
